    "standards for storing N-dimensional arrays of typed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chunks become more important as the size of the array increases.  For very large arrays, it \n",
    "is helpful to organize the memory it occupies into sub-units.  These sub-units are the \n",
    "chunks.  Note that this is not another dimension to the array, but merely a map to how the \n",
    "large array is partitioned into more palatable sized units for manipulation in memory. \n",
    "Array-handling libraries (`numpy`, `xarray`, `pandas`, and others) will handle all of the \n",
    "record-keeping to know which chunk holds a given unit of the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example - first principles\n",
    "A quick side-bar to illustrate two chunking patterns for a simple 2D array.  This is a \n",
